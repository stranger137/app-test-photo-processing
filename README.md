# app-test-photo-processing
It is an application made on PyQt5 which gives you a psychological test and then processes the photo of the result and offers the photo for downloading.

<b>Getting started</b>

Install the latest version of Python 3. (https://www.python.org/downloads/) Execute commands "pip install matplotlib", "pip install Pillow", "pip install PyQt5" at your command line. Open main.py at your IDE and execute it.

<b>Interface</b>

In the beginning enter your name at the label and press the start button. After this, answer 32 questions by moving the slider. The left side means total disagreement, the right side means total agreement, the center means indifferent attitude to the question. You may choose one of seven slider positions. If you press the editor tab, the message having an error will appear and you will be returned to the test. If you would like to change your answer, press the back button and change the slider position. All answers are saved in memory, so you may change your answers at any time. After passing the test, you will see the name and the description of your psychological type and the bar chart of your score. You may click at the editor tab, there you will have a photo having a Winnie-the-Pooh character (the photo depends on your results) with a sign on it. You may edit the photo with the appropriate tabs. When you would like to save the result, press the save button and you will see the name of the photo which is in the same directory as the whole program.
